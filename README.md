<h1>Instructions</h1>
The project we have created is a game from Google - it is the dinosaur
game that you play when you do not have connection to the internet. 
The object of the game is to avoid the obstacles (bats and rocks) that come
at you and get as far as you can. Whenever you get past an obstacle, your 
score is incremented by 2.

The controls for this game are simple. BTNU is a jump - your dinosaur will
jump over obstacles into the air and come back down. BTND is a duck - your 
dinosaur will duck under obstacles. BTNC is a reset - when you die, the game
will stop until you press BTNC. Once you do, the game will start over from
the beginning.

Bats will kill you when they reach you unless you duck under them. If you 
are running or jumping, the bat will kill you. Rocks will kill you when they 
reach you unless you are jumping over them. If you are running or ducking, 
the rock will kill you.
